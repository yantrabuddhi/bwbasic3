        AND RESTORE STATEMENTS.
    ANSI STANDARD 14.2, 14.4

SECTION 95.1: GENERAL SYNTAX AND SEMANTICS OF READ AND DATA

THIS SECTION EXERCISES SOME OF THE GENERAL CAPABILITIES
AND PROPERTIES OF THE READ AND DATA STATEMENTS, AS LISTED:
  1) READ AND DATA CAN MIX STRING AND NUMERIC DATA
  2) CONTROL FALLS THROUGH DATA STATEMENTS WITHOUT EFFECT
  3) DATA STATEMENTS MAY BE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT SOURCE
  4) READ AND DATA LISTS CAN OVERLAP
  5) READ CAN ACCESS DATA ANYWHERE IN SOURCE

SECTION 95.2: RESTORE STATEMENT

THIS SECTION TESTS THE CAPABILITY OF THE RESTORE STATEMENT
TO ENABLE READING FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE DATA SEQUENCE.
FURTHERMORE, DATA VALUES WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY READ AS
NUMERIC MAY BE SUBSEQUENTLY READ AS STRINGS, AND 
VICE-VERSA, AS LONG AS DATA-TYPE IS COMPATIBLE WITH
VARIABLE-TYPE.
