    ANSI STANDARD 8.4                                                           
                                                                                
SECTION 137.1: POKER TEST FOR RND FUNCTION.                                     
                                                                                
THIS PROGRAM CATEGORIZES FIXED-SIZE GROUPS OF RANDOM NUMBERS                    
BASED ON HOW MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF NUMBER ARE IN EACH                         
GROUP. A TYPE IS DETERMINED BY WHICH FRACTION OF THE 0 - 1                      
SEGMENT THE VALUE OF THE NUMBER FALLS WITHIN. CHI-SQUARE                        
IS THEN COMPUTED AND DISPLAYED AS THE RESULT TO SEE IF                          
IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION FOR UNIFORM                     
RANDOM NUMBERS.
