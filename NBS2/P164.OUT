PROGRAM FILE 164: GENERAL USE OF NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS
        IN LET-STATEMENT.
    ANSI STANDARD 6.2, 6.4, 7.2, 7.4, 8.2, 8.4, 
                  16.2, 16.4

THIS PROGRAM EXERCISES THE FULL RANGE OF USES AND VARIETIES
OF NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS IN THE LET-STATEMENT. EXPRESSIONS ARE
COMPOSED OF ALL TYPES OF PRIMARIES AND ARE USED AS ARGUMENTS
OF FUNCTIONS AND AS SUBSCRIPTS.

SECTION 164.1: NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS CONTAINING
        SUBSCRIPTED VARIABLES AND FUNCTION REFERENCES.

THIS SECTION TESTS WHETHER SUBSCRIPTED VARIABLES AND
REFERENCES TO BOTH IMPLEMENTATION-SUPPLIED AND
USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS CAN BE USED AS PRIMARIES IN
NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS.

                 BEGIN TEST.

CASE #         SHOULD BE      ACTUAL         OUTCOME

 1              1              1              OK 
 2              1              1.             OK 
 3              7              7.             OK 
 4              3              3.             OK 

*** TEST PASSED ***

                  END TEST.

SECTION 164.2: NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS USED AS FUNCTION
        ARGUMENTS AND ARRAY SUBSCRIPTS.

THIS SECTION TESTS WHETHER NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS CAN BE
USED AS ARGUMENTS TO BOTH IMPLEMENTATION-SUPPLIED AND
USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS AND ALSO AS SUBSCRIPTS.

                 BEGIN TEST.

CASE #         SHOULD BE      ACTUAL         OUTCOME

 1              1              1.             OK 
 2              1.2            1.2            OK 
 3              .353336        .353336        OK 

*** TEST PASSED ***

                  END TEST.

SECTION 164.3: EXPRESSIONS USED AS SUBSCRIPTS ARE
        ROUNDED TO NEAREST INTEGER.

THIS SECTION ENSURES THAT WHEN EXPRESSIONS ARE USED AS
SUBSCRIPTS, THEY ARE ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST INTEGER.

                 BEGIN TEST.

CASE #         SHOULD BE      ACTUAL         OUTCOME

 1              27             27             OK 
 2              1              1              OK 
 3              11             11             OK 
 4              1              1              OK 
 5              71             71             OK 

*** TEST PASSED ***

                  END TEST.
