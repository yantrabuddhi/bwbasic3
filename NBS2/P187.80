     THIS PROGRAM TESTS TO SEE IF THE BASIC PROCESSOR                           
ACCEPTS PROGRAMS CONTAINING LINES BEGINNING WITH SPACES.                        
                                                                                
THIS IS A TEST FOR A NON-STANDARD FEATURE OF MINIMAL BASIC.                     
TO PASS THIS TEST, THE PROCESSOR MUST EITHER:                                   
                                                                                
   1) ACCEPT THE PROGRAM AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY DOCUMENTATION                    
      ACCURATELY DESCRIBING THE FEATURE'S INTERPRETATION                        
      BY THE PROCESSOR, OR                                                      
                                                                                
   2) REJECT THE PROGRAM WITH AN APPROPRIATE ERROR MESSAGE
