THIS PROGRAM TESTS TO SEE IF THE BASIC PROCESSOR                                
ACCEPTS PROGRAMS CONTAINING SPACES WITHIN KEYWORDS.                             
                                                                                
THIS IS A TEST FOR A NON-STANDARD FEATURE OF MINIMAL BASIC.                     
TO PASS THIS TEST, THE PROCESSOR MUST EITHER:                                   
                                                                                
   1) ACCEPT THE PROGRAM AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY DOCUMENTATION                    
      ACCURATELY DESCRIBING THE FEATURE'S INTERPRETATION
