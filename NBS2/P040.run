PROGRAM FILE 40: ACCURACY OF SUBTRACTION                                        
    ANSI STANDARD 7.2, 7.4, 7.6                                                 
                                                                                
*** NOTE: THIS PROGRAM MAKES USE OF 'READ' AND 'DATA'                           
    WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED. IF SUBSEQUENT TESTS SHOW                    
    THESE FEATURES TO BE INCORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED, THEN THE                      
    VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST ROUTINE IS DOUBTFUL.                   
                                                                                
SECTION 40.1 ACCURACY OF SUBTRACTION.                                           
                                                                                
THIS SECTION TESTS THE ACCURACY OF SUBTRACTION. THE COMPUTED                    
RESULT IS COMPARED WITH A RANGE ESTABLISHED BY PERTURBING                       
EACH OPERAND BY 1 IN ITS 6TH DIGIT. THE RESULT PASSES IF                        
IT FALLS WITHIN THE EXTREME VALUES GENERATED BY THIS                            
PERTURBATION (ACCURATE TO SIX DIGITS).                                          
                                                                                
THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY, SINCE THE ANSI STANDARD                          
DOES NOT MANDATE ANY ACCURACY FOR NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS.
