    ANSI STANDARD 5.6, 13.4                                                     
                                                                                
SECTION 111.1: EXCEPTION - NUMERIC UNDERFLOW ON INPUT                           
        CAUSES REPLACEMENT BY ZERO.                                             
                                                                                
TO PASS THIS TEST:                                                              
                                                                                
    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MAY BE                               
       DISPLAYED (NOT MANDATORY), AND                                           
                                                                                
    2) ZERO MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE OF THE                                
       NUMERIC CONSTANT IN THE INPUT-REPLY.                                     
                                                                                
AFTER THE INPUT-PROMPT, ENTER 1E-99999. THIS IS INTENDED                        
TO CAUSE NUMERIC UNDERFLOW. IF IT DOES, THE PROCESSOR                           
MUST SET THE VALUE OF THE VARIABLE TO ZERO.                                     
                                                                                
SINCE '1E-99999' IS A SYNTACTICALLY LEGAL NUMBER,                               
IF THE PROCESSOR DOES NOT ACCEPT 1E-99999 AS INPUT,
