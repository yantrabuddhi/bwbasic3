        NUMERIC CONSTANTS.
    ANSI STANDARD 5.4, 5.6

THIS PROGRAM TESTS VARIOUS CASES OF CONSTANT UNDERFLOW.

SECTION 34.1: POSITIVE CONSTANT UNDERFLOW

THIS SECTION TESTS THE RESULT OF CONSTANT EVALUATION
LESS THAN POSITIVE MACHINE INFINITESIMAL.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING AN EXCEPTION MAY BE
       DISPLAYED (NOT MANDATORY), AND

    2) ZERO MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE

*** TEST PASSED *** 

                END TEST

SECTION 34.2: NEGATIVE CONSTANT UNDERFLOW

THIS SECTION TESTS THE RESULT OF CONSTANT EVALUATION
GREATER THAN NEGATIVE MACHINE INFINITESIMAL.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) A MESSAGE IDENTIFYING THE EXCEPTION MAY BE
       DISPLAYED (NOT MANDATORY), AND

    2) ZERO MUST BE SUPPLIED AS THE VALUE

               BEGIN TEST

RESULT OF ASSIGNING -3E-99999 =  0
