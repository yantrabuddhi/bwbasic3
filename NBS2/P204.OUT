SECTION 204.1: ERROR - PRINT-STATEMENTS CONTAINING
        LOWERCASE CHARACTERS.

THIS PROGRAM TESTS TO SEE IF THE PROCESSOR ACCEPTS PROGRAMS
CONTAINING LOWER CASE CHARACTERS IN A PRINT-STATEMENT.

THIS IS A TEST FOR A NON-STANDARD FEATURE OF MINIMAL BASIC.
TO PASS THIS TEST, THE PROCESSOR MUST EITHER:

1) ACCEPT THE PROGRAM AND BE ACCOMPANIED BY DOCUMENTATION
   ACCURATELY DESCRIBING THE FEATURE'S INTERPRETATION
   BY THE PROCESSOR, OR

2) REJECT THE PROGRAM WITH AN APPROPRIATE ERROR MESSAGE

SEE THE NBS MINIMAL BASIC TEST PROGRAMS USER'S MANUAL
FOR DETAILED CRITERIA.

                              BEGIN TEST.

IF A BLANK LINE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDES THIS SENTENCE, THEN
THE PROCESSOR EXECUTED A PRINT STATEMENT IN WHICH THE
WORD 'PRINT' APPEARS IN LOWERCASE LETTERS.


this sentence is generated by a quoted-string print-item
containing lower-case characters.

                               END TEST.
