EXPRESSIONS USING ONLY ONE OPERATOR AND CONSTANTS AND                           
SIMPLE VARIABLES ARE EVALUATED, AND THE RESULTS TESTED                          
AGAINST THE CORRECT VALUE. CONSTANTS ARE EXPRESSED IN                           
NR1, NR2, AND NR3 FORM. THE VALUES OF THE OPERANDS AND                          
RESULTS ARE RESTRICTED TO INTEGERS AND SIMPLE FRACTIONS                         
TO AVOID ACCURACY PROBLEMS (ACCURACY IS ADDRESSED IN
