SECTION 138.1: COUPON COLLECTOR TEST OF RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM TESTS HOW MANY RANDOM NUMBERS MUST BE GENERATED
(UP TO A MAXIMUM) TO GET AT LEAST ONE OF EACH TYPE. A TYPE IS
DETERMINED BY WHICH FRACTION OF THE 0 - 1 SEGMENT THE VALUE
OF THE NUMBER FALLS WITHIN. CHI-SQUARE IS COMPUTED AND
DISPLAYED TO SEE WHETHER IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE
EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION FOR UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERS.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY *****
