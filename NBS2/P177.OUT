SECTION 177.1: EXCEPTION - EVALUATION OF NUMERIC
        EXPRESSIONS IN THE IF-STATEMENT.

WHICH CAUSE NON-FATAL EXCEPTIONS.

TO PASS THIS TEST:

    1) TWO EXCEPTIONS MUST BE REPORTED: OVERFLOW, 
       AND ZERO RAISED TO A NEGATIVE POWER, AND

    2) POSITIVE MACHINE INFINITY MUST BE SUPPLIED AS
       THE VALUES OF THE EXPRESSIONS, AND

    3) THE IF MUST TEST EQUAL, AND EXECUTION CONTINUES.

                   BEGIN TEST.

ABOUT TO EXECUTE:
   IF (-1E-33) ^ (-4444) = 0 ^ (-1E-33)

*** Arithmetic Overflow ***
*** Arithmetic Overflow ***
IF OVERFLOW AND ZERO TO NEGATIVE POWER EXCEPTIONS
   WERE REPORTED, THEN
*** TEST PASSED ***
