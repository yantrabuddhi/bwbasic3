PROGRAM FILE 41: ACCURACY OF MULTIPLICATION                                     
    ANSI STANDARD 7.2, 7.4, 7.6                                                 
                                                                                
*** NOTE: THIS PROGRAM MAKES USE OF 'READ' AND 'DATA'                           
    WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED. IF SUBSEQUENT TESTS SHOW                    
    THESE FEATURES TO BE INCORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED, THEN THE                      
    VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST ROUTINE IS DOUBTFUL.                   
                                                                                
SECTION 41.1 ACCURACY OF MULTIPLICATION.                                        
                                                                                
THIS SECTION TESTS THE ACCURACY OF MULTIPLICATION. THE                          
COMPUTED RESULT IS COMPARED WITH A RANGE ESTABLISHED BY                         
PERTURBING EACH OPERAND BY 1 IN ITS 6TH DIGIT. THE RESULT                       
PASSES IF IT FALLS WITHIN THE EXTREME VALUES GENERATED BY                       
THIS PERTURBATION (ACCURATE TO SIX DIGITS).                                     
                                                                                
THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY, SINCE THE ANSI STANDARD                          
DOES NOT MANDATE ANY ACCURACY FOR NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS.
