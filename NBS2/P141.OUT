SECTION 141.1: MAXIMUM OF GROUP TEST OF RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM FINDS THE MAXIMUM RANDOM NUMBER AMONG FIXED-
SIZE GROUPS AND DETERMINES WHETHER THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE
MAXIMA IS SUFFICIENTLY CLOSE TO THE EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION
FOR UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERS OF F(X) = X^T, WHERE T IS THE
SIZE OF THE GROUPS. THE KOMOLGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST IS USED
TO MEASURE HOW WELL THE RESULTS MATCH THE EXPECTATION.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY *****

                     BEGIN TEST


    K+ =  .721119                PERCENTILE FOR K+ =  .646554 
    K- =  7.41161E-2             PERCENTILE FOR K- =  1.09263E-2 

PERCENTILES SHOULD BE BETWEEN .05 AND .95
