PROGRAM FILE 46: INTERACTION OF CONTROL STATEMENTS WITH
        THE FOR-STATEMENT.
    ANSI STANDARD 11.2, 11.4, 10.2, 10.4

SECTION 46.1: INTERACTION OF GOSUB-STATEMENT WITH
        THE FOR-STATEMENT.

THIS SECTION TESTS THAT A GOSUB ROUTINE CAN BE EXPECTED
FROM WITHIN A FOR-BLOCK.

               BEGIN TEST.

CONTROL VARIABLE:
SHOULD BE      ACTUAL         RESULT

SHOULD BE:  4      ACTUAL:  4     RESULT:   OK  

*** TEST PASSED ***

               END TEST.

SECTION 46.2: FOR-LOOPS WITH SAME CONTROL-VARIABLE
        NESTED DYNAMICALLY WITH GOSUB.

THIS SECTION TESTS THAT A GOSUB ROUTINE CAN BE EXECUTED
FROM WITHIN A FOR-BLOCK AND THAT THE SUBROUTINE MAY ITSELF
CONTAIN A FOR-BLOCK. IF THE TWO FOR-BLOCKS USE THE SAME
CONTROL-VARIABLE, THE ORIGINAL VALUE IS LOST.

               BEGIN TEST.

CONTROL VARIABLE:
SHOULD BE      ACTUAL         RESULT

*** TEST PASSED ***

               END TEST.


SECTION 46.3 CONTROL-STATEMENT JUMPS OUT OF FOR-BLOCK.

THIS SECTION TESTS THAT YOU CAN JUMP OUT OF A FOR-BLOCK
AND THAT THE CONTROL-VARIABLE RETAINS ITS VALUE WHEN
THIS HAPPENS.

             BEGIN TEST.

LOOP IS: FOR I1= 33  TO  66  STEP  4
