PROGRAM FILE 24: PLUS AND MINUS
    ANSI STANDARD 7.2, 7.4

THIS PROGRAM TESTS THE GROSS SEMANTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE PLUS AND MINUS OPERATORS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF
NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS.

EXPRESSIONS USING ONLY ONE OPERATOR AND CONSTANTS AND
SIMPLE VARIABLES ARE EVALUATED, AND THE RESULTS TESTED
AGAINST THE CORRECT VALUE. CONSTANTS ARE EXPRESSED IN
NR1, NR2, AND NR3 FORM, BUT ARE GENERALLY RESTRICTED TO
INTEGER VALUES TO AVOID ACCURACY PROBLEMS (ACCURACY IS
ADDRESSED IN LATER TESTS).
