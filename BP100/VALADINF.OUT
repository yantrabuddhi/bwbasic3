         VALUE OF ADDITIONAL SAMPLE INFORMATIOM

IN SITUATIONS WHERE SAMPLING IS DONE IT IS GENERALLY ASSUMED
THAT LARGER SAMPLES PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRUE
SITUATION THAN DO SMALLER SAMPLES. THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
WHICH THE LARGER SAMPLE SIZE BRINGS COULD BE COMPUTED IF
WE COULD SOMEHOW MEASURE THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE INFORMATION
BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER TAKING THE SAMPLE. SUCH A MEASURE
OF UNCERTAINTY EXISTS AND IS SOMETIMES CALLED SHANNON
INFORMATION. THIS PROGRAM GIVES BOUNDS ON THE UNCERTAINTY
WHEN THE SAMPLING IS COMING FROM A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION WITH
BOUNDED VARIANCE.

NECESSARY INPUT INCLUDES AN UPPER BOUND ON THE VARIANCE
OF THE DISTRIBUTION, THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS IN THE
INITIAL SAMPLE AND THE ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS IN
THE FINAL SAMPLE.
