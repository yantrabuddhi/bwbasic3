         NET PRESENT VALUE OF PROJECT

MOST INVESTMENT PROJECTS INVOLVE SOME INITIAL COST AND THEN
INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS IN THE FUTURE UNTIL SOME TIME WHEN
WHEN THE INVESTMENT IS TERMINATED. BASED UPON THE RISK IN THE
ORIGINAL INVESTMENT THE INVESTOR SHOULD HAVE SOME REQUIRED
RATE OF RETURN HE/SHE DESIRES TO EARN FROM THE INVESTMENT.
IF THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE PROJECT
ARE POSITIVE WHEN USING THE REQUIRED RATE AS THE DISCOUNT RATE
THEN THE PROJECT IS A REASONABLE ONE TO INVEST IN.THIS
PROGRAM COMPUTES THE PRESENT VALUE OF SUCH A PROJECT. IF THE
USER SETS THE INITIAL INVESTMENT EQUAL TO 0 THEN THE PRESENT
VALUE EQUALS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT TO BE PAID INITIALLY FOR THE
PROJECT.
