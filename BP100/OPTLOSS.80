         OPPORTUNITY LOSS TABLE                                                 
THIS PROGRAM ASSUMES THERE ARE FROM 1 TO 6 STATES OF NATURE.                    
THERE ARE ALSO FROM 1 TO 6 POSSIBLE ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE. IF THE                 
STATE OF NATURE(S OF N) IS KNOWN THEN EACH ACTION LEADS TO                      
A KNOWN MONETARY RESULT. THIS RESULT IS A CONDITIONAL PROFIT.                   
FOR EXAMPLE, IF ACTION 3 LEADS TO A $35 PAYOFF WHEN STATE OF                    
NATURE 4 IS TRUE THEN 35 IS THE CONDITIONAL PROFIT OF ACTION                    
3 GIVEN STATE OF NATURE 4. IF WE LOOK AT THE CONDITIONAL                        
PROFIT OF EACH ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR S OF N                       
THEN THERE IS A LARGEST PROFIT. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH EACH OF                     
THE OTHER PROFITS DIFFER FROM THE MAXIMUM IS CALLED THE                         
OPPORTUNITY LOSS OF THE CORRESPONDING ACTION FOR THE                            
PARTICULAR STATE OF NATURE. IN THIS PROGRAM ALL OF THE                          
CONDITIONAL PROFITS ARE ENTERED AND AN OPPORTUNITY LOSS
