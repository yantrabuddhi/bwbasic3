         FUTURE PRICES WITH INFLATION                                           
                                                                                
IN THESE DAYS OF INFLATION WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW                            
THE PRICE OF AN ITEM IN THE FUTURE IS RELATED TO THE                            
PRICE OF THAT ITEM TODAY. THERE ARE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS                       
BUT A VERY GOOD ESTIMATE IS THAT THE % RISE IN THE COST OF                      
THE ITEM  WILL EQUAL THE % RISE IN THE COST OF LIVING.                          
                                                                                
THE PRESENT PROGRAM TAKES THE PRESENT PRICE OF THE ITEM
