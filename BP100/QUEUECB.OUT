         WAITING LINE ANALYSIS

WAITING LINES OCCUR IN ALMOST ANY SYSTEM FROM THE SUPERMARKET
CHECKOUT COUNTER TO THE RUNWAY AT AN AIRPORT. IN ANALYZING
A WAITING LINE SITUATION, ON THE ONE HAND LONG WAITING LINES
CAUSE LOSS OF BUSINESS EVEN IF ONLY DUE TO CUSTOMER DISSAT-
FACTION WHILE INCREASING SERVICE INCREASES COSTS. IN THIS
PROGRAM WE EXAMINE THE CHANGE IN COSTS DUE TO INCREASING THE
SERVICE RATE BY ADDING SERVERS TO THE SYSTEM.
THE APPROPRAIATE PARAMETERS ARE:
MEAN ARRIVAL RATE OF UNITS(CUSTOMERS) INTO OUR SYSTEM.
MEAN SERVICE RATE CAPABILITY BY 1 SERVER.
COST PER UNIT TIME PER SERVER
OPPORTUNITY COST PER UNIT TIME PER ITEM ON QUEUE.
