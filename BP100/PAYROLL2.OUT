              PAYROLL PROGRAM

THIS PROGRAM IS A BRIEF IN-MEMORY PAYROLL SYSTEM. ESSENTIALLY
IT IS A PROGRAM WHICH COMPUTES FEDERAL AND FICA WITHHOLDING
AND STORES PAY RECORDS IN A FORM WHICH PERMITS EASY ACCESS
TO THOSE INTERESTED IN 941 OR W-2 FORMS. THERE IS,AT PRESENT,
NO PROVISION FOR STATE OR LOCAL WITHHOLDING BUT THIS CAN BE
HANDLED VIA THE 'OTHER DEDUCTIONS' CATEGORY. THE DIMENSIONING
LIMITS THE PAYROLL MASTER FILE TO 25 EMPLOYEES, THOUGH THIS
MAY BE INCREASED IF MUCH MAIN MEMORY IS AVAILABLE.
REMEMBER THAT THE MASTER MUST BE RECALLED FROM STORAGE BEFORE
OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED AND RESTORED AFTER THE OPERATIONS.
