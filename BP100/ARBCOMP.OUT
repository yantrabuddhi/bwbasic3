         ARBITRAGE COMPUTATIONS

ARBITRAGE IS SIMPLY BUYING AN ARTICLE IN ONE MARKET AND
SELLING IT IN ANOTHER MARKET, HOPEFULLY AT A HIGHER PRICE.
IN THE STOCK MARKET THIS MAY INVOLVE BUYING ONE SECURITY
AND SELLING ANOTHER EQUIVALENT SECURITY IN THE SAME MARKET.
THIS TYPE OF ARBITRAGE OCCURS WHEN MERGERS ARE BEING CONSID-
ERED. OWNERS OF ONE SECURITY MAY TRADE THEM IN FOR ANOTHER
PACKAGE OF SECURITIES. IN THIS CASE THE OWNERS OF THE FIRST
SECURITY MAY WONDER WHAT THE VALUE OF THE SECOND PACKAGE IS.
THIS PROGRAM EVALUATES THE VALUE OF A PACKAGE OF DIFFERENT
SECURITIES. IN A MERGER A PACKAGE OF COMPANY A SECURITIES AND
CASH ARE GENERALLY TRADED FOR A PACKAGE OF COMPANY B SECURITIES
USUALLY SOME SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.
