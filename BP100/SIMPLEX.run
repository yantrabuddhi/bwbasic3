         LINEAR PROGRAMMING                                                     
                                                                                
LINEAR PROGRAMMING IS A MATHEMATICAL TOOL DESIGNED TO HELP                      
MANAGEMENT TO MAKE OPTIMUM USE OF COMPETING RESOURCES.                          
IT IS A VERY POPULAR TECHNIQUE AND INVOLVES LINEAR INEQUALITIES                 
CALLED CONSTRAINTS AND A LINEAR OBJECTIVE FUNCTION WHICH                        
WE TRY TO MAXIMIZE OR MINIMIZE. THE INTERESTED USER MAY                         
CONSULT ANY INTRODUCTORY TEXT IN FINITE MATHEMATICS FOR                         
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.                                                         
                                                                                
THE NUMBERS OF VARIABLES AND CONSTRAINTS ARE ONLY                               
LIMITED BY AVAILABLE MEMORY BUT MANY VARIABLE PROBLEMS                          
MAY TAKE A LONG TIME TO RUN.
