    ANNUITY COMPUTATION  BY DR. PETER SHENKIN                                   
   AN ANNUITY IS ANY SET OF EQUAL PAYMENTS MADE AT                              
EQUAL INTERVALS OF TIME. WITH AN ORDINARY  ANNUITY                              
PAYMENTS ARE MADE AT THE ENDS OF THE  PERIODS  DE-                              
FINED BY THESE TIME INTERVALS. FOR AN ANNUITY  DUE                              
THE PAYMENTS ARE MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PER-                              
IODS IN QUESTION.  THE PRESENT VALUE OF AN ANNUITY                              
IS THE AMOUNT OF CASH ONE WOULD ACCEPT NOW INSTEAD                              
OF THE SEQUENCE OF FUTURE PAYMENTS. BECAUSE  MONEY                              
HAS TIME VALUE (INTEREST IS CHARGED)  THE  PRESENT                              
VALUE DOES NOT EQUAL THE SUM OF THE PAYMENTS.  tHE                              
FUTURE VALUE OF AN ANNUITY IS THE  AMOUNT  OF CASH                              
WHICH WOULD ACCUMULATE BY THE END  OF THE  ANNUITY                              
IF THE INDIVIDUAL PAYMENTS ARE  INVESTED  AT   THE                              
PREVAILING INTEREST RATE.

MANY  ANNUITIES ALSO INVOLVE A LAST BALLOON PAY-                                
MENT.IN THE ANNUITY PROBLEMS WE EXAMINE,THE VARIABLES                           
OF INTEREST ARE  NUMBER OF PAYMENTS,INTEREST RATE PER                           
PERIOD,PAYMENT PER PERIOD,PRESENT OR FUTURE VALUE,AND

FIND THE FIFTH VARIABLE WHEN CONSIDERING THE PRESENT                            
VALUE SITUATION. IN THE FUTURE VALUE CASE NO BALLOON                            
PAYMENTS ARE CONSIDERED AS IN THIS CASE A  BALLOON                              
PAYMENT OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT WOULD ADD THAT AMOUNT
