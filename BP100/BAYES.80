         BAYES PROBABILITIES                                                    
                                                                                
THIS THEOREM USES BAYES THEOREM TO REVISE ESTIMATES OF                          
THE PROBABILITIES OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE VARIOUS STATES OF                    
NATURE. INPUT TO THIS PROGRAM ARE THE PROBABILITIES OF A                        
A FINITE AND USER SELECTABLE NUMBER OF STATES OF NATURE,                        
THESE PROBABILITIES MUST SUM UP TO 1. IN ADDITION,                              
THERE MUST BE INPUT FOR EACH STATE OF NATURE THE PROBABILITY                    
OF A CERTAIN EVENT,SAY B, OCCURRING GIVEN THAT STATE OF                         
IS THE TRUE STATE OF NATURE. THEN THE PROGRAM WILL COMPUTE                      
THE CONDITIONAL PROBAILITIES OF EACH OF THE STATES OF NATURE                    
BEING TRUE GIVEN THAT EVENT B OCCURS. THESE ARE CALLED                          
POSTERIOR PROBABILITIES AND MAY BE USED IN DECISION MAKING
