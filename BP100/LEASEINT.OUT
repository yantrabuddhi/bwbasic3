               LEASE INTEREST RATE
THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF EQUIPMENT LEASES. ONE TYPE OF AUTO
LEASE IS CALLED AN OPEN END LEASE. THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT
THE LESSEE PAYS THE LEASING COMPANY A DOWN PAYMENT AND A FIXED
AMOUNT EACH MONTH FOR A GIVEN NUMBER OF MONTHS. AT THE END
OF THE LEASE PERIOD THE LESSEE MUST PAY THE LEASING COMPANY A
PRE-AGREED AMOUNT (BUY-BACK AMOUNT). THE LESSEE THEN OWNS THE
CAR. THERE ARE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES TO LEASING. IF THE INITIAL
DOWN PAYMENT IS LOW AND PAYMENTS ARE LESS PER MONTH THAN ON A
STRAIGHT LOAN THEN THE LESSEE PAYS LESS MONEY EARLY THAN
ON THE LOAN. THE BALLOON PAYMENT MAKES UP FOR THIS LATER.
THE PRESENT PROGRAM COMPUTES AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE ON THE
LEASE GIVEN THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE CAR, THE DOWN PAYMENT
THE MONTHLY PAYMENT, AND THE BUY-BACK AMOUNT.

IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE BUY-BACK OCCURS ONE MONTH AFTER THE
LAST PAYMENT. IF THE LAST PAYMENT AND THE BUY-BACK OCCUR AT
THE SAME TIME THEN DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PAYMENTS BY 1 AND
INCREASE THE BUY-BACK BY THE AMOUNT OF 1 PAYMENT

   IN ADDITION, THE FIRST PAYMENT MAY BE AT THE END OF THE
1ST MONTH, 2ND MONTH, ETC.
