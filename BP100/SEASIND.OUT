    SEASONAL INDEX FOR A TIME SERIES

MOST BUSINESSES SHOW SEASONAL VARIATIONS OF SALES. THAT MEANS
THAT THE SALES AT ONE TIME OF THE YEAR ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE
AT OTHER TIMES YEAR AFTER YEAR. THE SEASONAL INDEX FOR A
SEASON(OR MONTH) IS THE PERCENTAGE THAT SEASON'S SALES ARE OF
THE SALES IN AN 'AVERAGE' SEASON. FOR EXAMPLE IF A STORE SELLS
$60,00 PER YEAR, OR $5,000 PER MONTH AND AVERAGES $8,000
DURING JUNE THEN THE INDEX FOR JUNE IS 160.

THIS PROGRAM WILL COMPUTE SEASONAL INDICES. WHAT IS
NECESARY IS THE INPUT OF SALES AMOUNTS FOR EACH SEASON FOR
AT LEAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE PROGRAM WILL ACCEPT FEWER YEARS
BUT THE RESULTS WOULD BE MEANINGLESS.
