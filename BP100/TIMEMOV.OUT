SIMPLE MOVING AVERAGE SMOOTHING PROGRAM

THIS PROGRAM COMPUTES AN M-PERIOD MOVING AVERAGE FOR A SET OF
VALUES. M SHOULD BE AN ODD INTEGER,E.G 3,5,7,ETC. THERE SHOULD
BE MORE THAN M OBSERVATIONS TO GET MEANINGFUL RESULTS.

THIS IS AN M-PERIOD MOVING AVERAGE.WHAT DOES M EQUAL? 3

GIVE AN UPPER BOUND ON THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS YOU INTEND TO
USE.THIS WILL BE THE GREATEST NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS POSSIBLE.
NUMBER = ? 10
INPUT OBSERVATIONS 1 BY 1, PRESSING ENTER AFTER EACH.
INPUT 99999 AND ENTER WHEN DONE.
