COMPARING PRICES AT A FIXED TIME IN THE PAST, CALLED THE                        
BASE YEAR TO CURRENT PRICES IS NOT THAT SIMPLE. THIS IS                         
BECAUSE NEW ITEMS HIT THE MARKET AND USE OF OTHER ITEMS                         
CHANGE THROUGH THE YEARS. THE PAASCHE PRICE INDEX USES                          
A METHOD BY WHICH QUANTITIES FOR THE CURRENT YEAR ARE USED AND                  
ARE WEIGHTED ONCE WITH BASE YEAR PRICES AND ONCE WITH CURRENT                   
PRICES. THESE TWO WEIGHTINGS ARE DIVIDED AND THE QUOTIENT                       
IS MULTIPLIED BY 100 GIVING THE PAASCHE PRICE INDEX.                            
IF THE INDEX IS GREATER THAN 100 THEN PRICES HAVE INCREASED.
