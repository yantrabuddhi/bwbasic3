           TELEPHONE DIRECTORY

THIS PROGRAM SETS UP AN INDEX OF TELEPHONE NUMBERS ALONG WITH
THEIR OWNERS. EACH ENTRY CONSISTS OF A PHONE NUMBER, A PERSON,
AND A COMMENT. THE PROGRAM MAKES PROVISIONS FOR RECALLING
PHONE NUMBER BY NAME. WITH A 16K MACHINE THIS PROGRAM
WILL HANDLE 200 NUMBERS. WITH MORE MEMORY MORE NAMES SHOULD
FIT, THOUGH THE DIM STATEMENT IN THE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE TO BE
CHANGED ACCORDINGLY.

TO FACILITATE RECALL WE SUGGEST ENTERING NAMES AS
LASTNAME*FIRSTNAME E.G. SMITH*TOM. THE COMPUTER NEEDS A
PERFECT MATCH TO FIND THE NAME. THE NAME COULD ALSO BE
FOUND BY PRINTING A COMPLETE LIST.
