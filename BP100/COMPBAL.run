    LOAN RATE WITH COMPENSATING BALANCE                                         
                                                                                
WHEN A BUSINESSMAN BORROWS MONEY FROM A BANK HE IS SOMETIMES                    
REQUIRED TO KEEP A COMPENSATING BALANCE IN THE ACCOUNT.                         
A COMPENSATING BALANCE IS AN AMOUNT THAT THE BUSINESSMAN                        
PAYS INTEREST ON(AS HE HAS BORROWED IT) BUT WHICH HE                            
CANNOT WITHDRAW FROM HIS ACCOUNT. IF A 15% COMPENSATING                         
BALANCE IS REQUIRED,E.G. THIS MEANS THAT FOR EVERY $1,000                       
BORROWED THE BUSINESSMAN CAN ONLY WRITE CHECKS FOR $850.                        
THIS IS ONE METHOD A BANK USES TO RAISE THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST                  
RATE ON A LOAN. THE NOMINAL RATE ,IN THIS CASE, IS LOWER                        
THAN THE 'TRUE' EFFECTIVE RATE.
