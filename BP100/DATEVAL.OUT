         DATED VALUE FOR OBLIGATIONS

THE MATURITY VALUE OF AN OBLIGATION ALONG WITH THE DATE
OF MATURITY IS A DATED VALUE. AN EXAMPLE OF A DATED VALUE
WOULD BE $750 DUE ON SEPTEMBER 13,1980. DIFFERENT SETS OF
DATED VALUES MAY BE COMPARED BUT E.G. TO COMPARE $750 DUE ON
9/13/80 WITH $900 DUE ON 9/13/82 WE MUST PICK SOME INTEREST
RATE AND PERFORM SOME TYPE OF COMPOUND INTEREST ANALYSIS.
IN THE PRESENT PROGRAM THIS IS DONE. WE ARE GIVEN A DATED
VALUE MATURING SOME FIXED NUMBER OF YEARS IN THE FUTURE. WE
ARE ALSO AN INTEREST RATE TO BE USED IN COMPARISON. WHAT THE
PROGRAM THEN DOES IS FIND AN EQUIVALENT DEBT MATURING AT
SOME OTHER FIXED TIME IN THE FUTURE.

INPUT # OF YEARS INTO FUTURE FOR MATURITY OF DATED VALUE FOR
COMPARISON? 5

 1000 DUE IN 10 YEARS IS EQUIVALENT TO 783.526 DUE IN 5 YEARS
