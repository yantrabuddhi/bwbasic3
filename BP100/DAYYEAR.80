              DAY OF YEAR                                                       
                                                                                
GIVEN THE MONTH AND DAY OF A PARTICULAR DATE IN THE YEAR                        
THIS PROGRAM WILL CALCULATE ON WHICH DAY OF THE YEAR THAT DATE                  
OCCURS. FOR EXAMPLE 02/15 IS THE 46 TH DAY OF THE YEAR. FOR                     
ALL DATES AFTER FEBRUARY 28 THE PROGRAM PRINTS 2 ANSWERS, ONE                   
FOR A LEAP YEAR AND ONE FOR NON-LEAP YEARS.                                     
THE PROGRAM ALSO GIVES THE NUMBER OF DAYS FROM THE PRESENT                      
DATE TO THE PREVIOUSLY ENTERED DATE. A NEGATIVE HERE MEANS                      
THAT THE PRESENT DATE COMES LAST. THIS PART OF THE PROGRAM                      
GIVES AN INCORRECT ANSWER FOR FEBRUARY 29 DURING LEAP YEAR.
