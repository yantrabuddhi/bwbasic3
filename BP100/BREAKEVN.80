          BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS                                                   
                                                                                
FOR THIS PROGRAM,WE ASSUME THAT A COMPANY HAS CERTAIN                           
FIXED COSTS. tHIS COMPANY IS SELLING AN ITEM SUCH THAT                          
VARIABLE COST/UNIT SOLD OF THAT ITEM IS KNOWN. wE ALSO                          
KNOW THE PRICE AT WHICH THE ITEM IS SOLD. gIVEN THIS                            
INFORMATION WE CAN COMPUTE THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF THE                           
ITEM WHICH THE COMPANY MUST SELL TO JUST BREAK EVEN,                            
I.E. SO THAT THE NET SALE REVENUE JUST COVERS FIXED                             
COSTS. WE CAN ALSO COMPUTE THE NUMBER OF ITEMS THE                              
COMPANY MUST SELL TO MAKE ANY GIVEN PROFIT. THIS                                
PROGRAM  WILL DO BOTH TYPES OF COMPUTATIONS.
