30 PRINT"FOR THIS PROGRAM,WE ASSUME THAT A COMPANY HAS CERTAIN
35 PRINT"FIXED COSTS. tHIS COMPANY IS SELLING AN ITEM SUCH THAT
40 PRINT"VARIABLE COST/UNIT SOLD OF THAT ITEM IS KNOWN. wE ALSO
50 PRINT"KNOW THE PRICE AT WHICH THE ITEM IS SOLD. gIVEN THIS
55 PRINT"INFORMATION WE CAN COMPUTE THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF THE
60 PRINT"ITEM WHICH THE COMPANY MUST SELL TO JUST BREAK EVEN,
65 PRINT"I.E. SO THAT THE NET SALE REVENUE JUST COVERS FIXED
70 PRINT"COSTS. WE CAN ALSO COMPUTE THE NUMBER OF ITEMS THE
75 PRINT"COMPANY MUST SELL TO MAKE ANY GIVEN PROFIT. THIS
80 PRINT"PROGRAM  WILL DO BOTH TYPES OF COMPUTATIONS.
