THIS PROGRAM ASSUMES THERE ARE FROM 1 TO 6 STATES OF NATURE.                    
THERE ARE ALSO FROM 1 TO 6 POSSIBLE ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE. IF THE                 
STATE OF NATURE(S OF N) IS KNOWN THEN EACH ACTION LEADS TO                      
A KNOWN MONETARY RESULT. THIS RESULT IS A CONDITIONAL PROFIT.                   
FOR EXAMPLE, IF ACTION 3 LEADS TO A $35 PAYOFF WHEN STATE OF                    
NATURE 4 IS TRUE THEN 35 IS THE CONDITIONAL PROFIT OF ACTION                    
3 GIVEN STATE OF NATURE 4. THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM CONSTRUCTS                     
A MATRIX WITH ELEMENTS BEING THE CONDITIONAL PROFITS.                           
IN ADDITION THE PROBABILITY OF EACH S OF N IS ENTERED AND                       
THE EXPECTED VALUE OF EACH ACTION IS COMPUTED.
