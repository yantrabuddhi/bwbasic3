THIS PROGRAM INVOLVES AN INVENTORY PROBLEM FOR WHICH IT IS                      
ASSUMED THAT THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS HOLD:                                     
  THERE IS A CONSTANT ORDERING COST PER ORDER                                   
  INVENTORY HOLDING COST IS CONSTANT PER UNIT HELD                              
  NO BACKORDERS ARE PERMITTED (STOCKOUTS NOT ALLOWED)                           
  ORDER LEAD TIME IS CONSTANT AND KNOWN                                         
  DEMAND FOR THE ITEMS ARE CONSTANT AND UNIFORM THROUGH TIME                    
  THERE ARE NO QUANTITY PRICE BREAKS.                                           
                                                                                
WE SHALL INPUT LEAD TIME,ANNUAL DEMAND, ORDERING COST,                          
HOLDING COST PER UNIT PER YEAR AND UNIT PURCHASE PRICE.

OPTIMAL ORDER QUANTITY IS           2332.49 UNITS                               
THIS MEANS ORDER ABOUT 52.9287 TIMES PER YEAR.                                  
      OR ABOUT EVERY  6.89606 DAYS.
