These programs appear to work, and are part of regression testing.

Changes made:
a) add missing semicolon/comma in PRINT statements
b) change array names so they were not identical to scalar variable names
c) add spaces around reserved words
d) CASSETTE is not supported, use DISKETTE instead
e) add missing THEN after IF
f) change PRINT #1,X,Y to WRITE #1,X,Y
g) add exit for autmated testing

BASIC Programs from Sky & Telescope
By: The Editors of Sky Telescope | July 22, 2006
       
Sky & Telescope magazine is pleased to make available in machine-readable form the programs that have been published in its monthly Astronomical Computing department, which first appeared in April 1984, and later in the Computers in Astronomy department. These are offered as-is and without support.
The table on the following three pages lists the programs in reverse chronological order. Each name is a hyperlink; if you select the name and your Web browser supports simple ASCII file transfers, you'll automatically download the BASIC program.

Whenever possible the programs are written in simple generic BASIC, but there are unavoidable variations from one interpreter to another. In case of difficulties, check your BASIC manual. A few programs require specific graphics adapters or printers. To run these programs, you will need a BASIC interpreter for your computer. If you do not know if your computer has one, see Stuart Goldman's article, "BASICally Speaking," adapted from the April 1996 issue of S&T.

At the end of each program is a block indicating the issue of the magazine in which the program appeared together with supporting text and instructions. If you have any questions, please consult the original articles.
