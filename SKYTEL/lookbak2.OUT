Enter Matter Density of the universe, OmegaM (0 - 2.0)? 0.1
Enter Cosmological Constant, OmegaL (0. - 1.0)? 0.9
Will you enter (A)ge of the universe or (H)ubble constant? A
Enter Age of the universe NOW in billions of years? 16
Will you enter (T)ime THEN or (R)edshift of the light we see NOW? T
Enter Age of the universe THEN, in billions of years? 1
 Finding what redshift matches Age THEN ......
Age Factor NOW  (Age=Fac/H0) =  1.2766
Age of the universe NOW  =  16.0000
Age of the universe THEN =   1.0000
Light travel time        =  15.0000
Redshift of the light we see NOW      =    7.810
Scale of the universe NOW versus THEN =    8.810
Distance of object THEN =      4.235
Distance of object NOW  =     37.310
Luminosity Distance NOW =    328.712
Distance Modulus     =     50.018
Speed away from us THEN =   2.821
Speed away from us NOW  =   2.977
Hubble constant THEN   =     651.33
Hubble constant NOW    =      78.02
 * Not the object's own speed, but caused by the expansion of space.
